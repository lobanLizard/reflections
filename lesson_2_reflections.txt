What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

--- it created .git folder.  No commit has created.  I guess I am imagining something like creating an empty box in which files are stored in the future.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

--- I think the staging area makes sure what files should be committed.  This will make sure you don't put unnecessary files or forget to put necessary files.
